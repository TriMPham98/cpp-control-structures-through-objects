// The Yukon Widget Company manufactures widgets that weigh 12.5 pounds each.
// Write a program that calculates how many widgets are stacked on a pallet,
// based on the total weight of the pallet. The program should ask the user
// how much the pallet weighs by itself and with the widgets stacked on it.
// It should then calculate and display the number of widgets stacked on the pallet.
