// A bag of cookies holds 30 cookies. The calorie information 
// on the bag claims that there are 10 servings in the bag and 
// that a serving equals 300 calories. Write a program that asks 
// the user to input how many cookies he or she actually ate 
// and then reports how many total calories were consumed.
