// Write a program that asks for the user for the number of 
// males and the number of females registered in a class.
// The program should display the percentage of males and 
// females in the class.

// Hint: Suppose there are 8 males and 12 females in a class.
// There are 20 students in the class. The percentage of males
// can be calculated as 8 / 20 = 0.4, or 40 percent. The 
// percentage of females can be calculated as 12 / 20 = 0.6, 
// or 60 percent.
