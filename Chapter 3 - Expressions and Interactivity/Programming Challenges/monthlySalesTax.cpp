// A retail company must file a monthly sales tax report listing the sales
// for the month and the amount of sales tax collected. Write a program that
// asks for the month, the year, and the total amount collected at the cash
// register (i.e. sales plus sales tax). Assume the state tax is 4 percent,
// and the county sales tax is 2 percent. If the total amount collected is known 
// and the total sales tax is 6 percent, the amount of product sales may be 
// calculated as S = (T / 1.06)
// S is the product sales and T is the total income (product sales plus sales
// tax). The program should display a report similar to:
// 
// Month: October
// -------------------------
// Total Collected:     $ 26572.89
// Sales:               $ 25068.76
// County Sales Tax:    $ 501.38
// State Sales Tax:     $ 1002.75
// Total Sales Tax:     $ 1504.13
