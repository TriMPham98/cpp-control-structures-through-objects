// There are three seating categories at a stadium. For a softball
// game, Class A seats cost $15, Class B seats cost $12, and Class
// C seats cost $9. Write a program that asks how many tickets
// for each class of seats were sold, then displays the amount
// of income generated from ticket sales. Format your dollar amount
// in fixed-point notation, with two decimal places of precision,
// and be sure the decimal point is always displayed.
