// Write a program that asks the user for an angle, entered in radians. The program
// should then display the sine, cosine, and tangent of the angle. (Use the sin,
// cos, and tan library functions to determine these values.) The output should
// be displayed in fixed-point notation, rounded to four decimal places of 
// precision.
