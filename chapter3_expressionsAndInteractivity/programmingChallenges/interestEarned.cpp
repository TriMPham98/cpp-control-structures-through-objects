// Assuming there are no deposits other than the original investment,
// the balance in a savings account after one year may be calculated as
// Amount = Principal * (1 + Rate/T) ^ (T * Years)
// Principal is the balance in the savings account, Rate is the annual
// interest rate, and T is the number of times the interest is compounded
// during a year. T is 4 if the interest is compounded quarterly.

// Write a program that asks for the principal, the rate, and the number
// of times the interest is compounded. The program should display a report
// similar to:

// Interest Rate: 4.25%
// Times Compounded: 12
// Principal: $ 1000.00
// Interest: $ 43.34
// Amount in Savings: $ 1043.34
