// A vineyard owner is planting several new rows of grapevines, and needs to
// know how many grapevines to plant in each row. She has determined that
// after measuring the length of a future row, she can use the following formula
// to calculate the number of vines that will fit in the row, along with the trellis
// end-post assemblies that will need to be constructed at each end of the row:

// V = (R - 2E) / S

// The terms in the formula are:
// V is the number of grapevines that will fit in the row.
// R is the length of the row, in feet.
// E is the amount of space, in feet, used by an end-post assembly.
// S is the space between vines, in feet.

// Write a program that makes the calculation for the vineyard owner. The program
// should ask the user to input the following:
// - The length of the row, in feet
// - The amount of space used by an end-post assembly, in feet
// - The amount of space between the vines, in feet

// Once the input data has been entered, the program should calculate and display
// the number of grapevines that will fit in the row.
